# Summary 
A click counter in JavaScript is a simple web application that tracks the number of times a user clicks a button on a webpage. The button is typically created using HTML and CSS, while the click event is handled using JavaScript. When the button is clicked, the JavaScript code increments the count by one and updates the display on the page to show the new count. This application can be used to demonstrate basic concepts of web development, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript event handling.
